Perhaps I\u0027d say BDD would work best when introduced in projects/companies where you currently have a lack of communication between devs, QA\u0027s and managers etc. I\u0027ve worked with quite a few clients that have a large disconnect between those groups and it really hurts the quality of the product, and the development progress.",

Valhalla, panama, and loom \uD83D\uDC4C I dislike the whole fully backwards compatibility thing, particularly when the language maintainers are rather open about the features they feel are implemented badly, or should just be completely reimplemented. I personally feel like the break from java 8 to java 9 would\u0027ve been the only point to scrap the bad but that didn\u0027t happen, and most likely will never. So we work with what we\u0027ve got. Rust looks like a pretty interesting language. I\u0027ve dabbled with it a tiny bit so I wouldn\u0027t want to form a strong opinion about it yet, but I\u0027d definitely like to explore it more.",

Keep tasks small so at the end of the day it feels like you\u0027ve done a lot more. I also posted some advice in the poll discussion here a while back \u003Chttps://discordapp.com/channels/244230771232079873/424158229107572737/696070473808609360\u003E The one thing I would add to that, particularly for people new to WFH due to covid-19 is this: What we are experiencing right now in a lot of the world is not what WFH typically is. pre2020 We could go out in the morning, for lunch, in the evening, and at the weekend. Meet up with friends and/or colleagues, play sports, go to the cinema, go to a bar. WFH isn\u0027t about being shut indoors 24/7 and being limited to Microsoft Teams/zoom/skype etc.",

Prioritise and reprioritise anything that needs it (usually done by the PO) and we\u0027ll assign resources. These are often medium or low priority things. The exception is critical defects where access to the service is impaired/limited in some way, in which case it\u0027ll be assigned on to a developer immediately by QA.

I\u0027ll always say testing as you develop is best effort-wise (regardless of which development methodology you follow to do it), but really you should try to define an acceptable limit in your requirements based on your usecase. We\u0027ve had some clients that base their testing quality in relation to the number of support tickets they get. If they hit above a certain threshold of defect complaints then they\u0027re not doing enough testing.",

Be aware that you can always readjust if you see things might be going the wrong way. Just be careful that you don\u0027t fall into the trap of planning until the end of time.
